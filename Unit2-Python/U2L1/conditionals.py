#Here at the top we include any libraries. We will discuss this later in the unit!
import random

#These next lines of codes generate a random number from 1 to 9
random.seed(1)
num = random.randint(1,9)

#Uncomment the line #15 and comment line #12 when facilitating the debugging activity.
#num = 5

#TODO: write a line of code below that prints out the value of num




#TODO: Write a conditional statement that checks if num is less than 5. 
# If it is, print out a statement that reads the number is less than 5
#TODO: Update your conditional statement so that if the number is not less than 5 
# it prints out The number is greater than 5.
#TODO: Update the conditional once more that checks if num = 5 and 
# prints out The number is 5!




#Extension Practice
#TODO: Write a conditional that checks if the number is between 1 and 3 or not. 


#TODO: Write a conditional that checks if the number is in the beginning part of the range (1-3), 
# middle half (4-6), or latter part (7-9) of the range.



#TODO: Write a conditional that checks if a number is either 1 or 9 or not.


#TODO: Write a conditional that checks if the number is a multiple of 3


#TODO: Write a conditional that checks if the number is a multiple of 2. 
# If it is a multiple 2 check if the number is also a multiple of 4.
